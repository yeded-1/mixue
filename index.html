    Hi [Her Name],

    If you're reading this... thank you.

    I’ve been thinking about how to say everything I feel without messing it up again.
    And I realized I don’t need anything fancy.

    Just the truth.

    You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted to write into my life.
    No one else, no "other girl," no secret feelings.

    She was just background noise.
    You... you were the music.

    I know I hurt you. And that jealousy made it worse.
    But please believe me: I never let anyone into the place where I kept you.
    That part of me stayed locked—with only your name on the key.

    I’m not here to ask for us back unless you want it.
    I’m just here to let you know that out of everyone in the world...
    I chose you. I still do.

    You’re not a chapter.
    You’re the whole damn book.

    If I could code one last thing into the universe, it’d be this:

    if (she.feelsTheSame) {
        return us.again();
    } else {
        myLove.staysForever = true;
    }

    Always yours,
    [Your Name]
